Some smarty-pants quote goes here.

## Usage

You will need Datomic Pro free edition first. The recommended local storage is either the `dev` or `sql` adapter running on Postgres. How to get a Clojure webapp up and running with Datomic (and how to run Datomic) is beyond the scope of this; since I don't really intend for anyone to actually run this but me.

Install deps:

```bash
lein deps
```

Configure your storage, drop your key into the `.properties` file, etc.

You should now be able to run the webapp with:

```bash
lein ring server
```

Migrations will run automatically on the Datomic db.

To ingest from an Instapaper CSV export:

```bash
lein exec -p script/import_from_instapaper.clj /path/to/instapaper-export.csv
```

(Note that the `-p` flag is very important to run the lein-exec in the scope of the project and get its CLASSPATH.)

### Notes:

**Never** run `lein datomic initialize` -- it will destroy data, and we no longer use `lein datomic`'s concept of a schema file!
