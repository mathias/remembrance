# remembrance

A Clojure webapp.

## Usage

```
$ lein deps
$ lein ring server
```

To ingest from an Instapaper CSV export:
```
$ lein exec -p script/import_from_instapaper.clj /path/to/instapaper-export.csv
```

(Note that the `-p` flag is very important to run the lein-exec in the scope of the project and get its CLASSPATH.)
